In a few short weeks, I will finish an Information Systems MS program. I'm a Spanish major who nevertheless went into
work as a programmer, so the more formal education in computing has been an invaluable supplement to what I have taught
myself and what I have learned while in industry. I knew fairly little about OS hardening, even less about network
security. My understanding of HCI would be laughable, until you understood how much front-end development I've done in
my career. Then it's downright scary.

My point is, the program has been a fantastic means to expand my skill set, and I encourage anyone in computing with a
little extra money and a little free time in the evenings to take advantage of such opportunities. But, what greatly
troubles me is how many skills universities *don't* teach in their formal CS/IS instruction. Skills that are so
fundamental, they don't even rise to the level of "marketable skills"â€”employers simply expect candidates to have them,
and are astounded when they are lacking.

The MS program I am finishing is a two-year program. I am in my final semester. This is the first time any of the
professors has mentioned source control. The first! And, in this case, in a class wherein thirty-two different students
must collaborate on the same .NET and SQL codebase, source control was considered an option rather than a
requirement.

Thirty-two contributors. Source control *optional*.

My message to any educators who may stumble upon this post is this: fundamentals are important. Don't sacrifice them.
But please, in order to graduate the best-prepared students possible, supplement the fundamentals with work-critical
skills. Teach the students how to [refactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring), and that copying/pasting
blocks is a [code smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell). Teach them Python or Ruby
after you've taught them Assembly and C. Teach them meaningful variable names, useful comments, and not to use LOC count
as some sort of badge of honor.

If you do nothing else, teach them source control.
