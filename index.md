## About

### This Blog

This is just a place for me to muse about topics that interest me. These things may include (but are not limited to):
programming, IT, running, Spanish, transportation infrastructure, craft beer, *Firefly*, and reasons why [Patrick
Rothfuss](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/) is the most underrated author of our generation.

### The Author

My name is Edwin Sheldon. I'm a software engineer who has worked in the GIS and HIT industries. I code mainly in Python
and C#, and am a bit of a Linux/Unix enthusiast. Es mi dios la libertad.
